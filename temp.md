Hi,

First, I do not know if this the right community to ask this question? so if it is not where I can ask it?

I took [Stephen Grider course on blockchain][1], then I knew about the Hyperledger Fabric. Now I want to start learn Fabric, and I would like to know how, and what the skills I need to start. Also, do you think is this the right thing to do?

small note: considering that, I think the course introduced the blockchain, but did not explain it that mush.

I can not know where is my level in programming, but I think it is somewhere between beginner and intermediate. I am now working on Odoo developing not a real jop just training, and that is why I think about Hyperledger Fabric as a place to start.

which I think has nothing to do with Blockchain, but I thought it is the best way to understand the developing process and see a real system, and for sure I need a fast way to earn money
