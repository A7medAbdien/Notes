1. dev video x10 (NOT DONE)
2. some explanation with the sales manager
    * this discussion toke two hours. I could not understand what he was asking about for the whole two hours, it seemed to me that he did not have a clear issue or problem. I asked him to explain it, then I asked him to write it, eventually, I asked him clearly, "what is the problem? I can not get what you asking about." He responds, "There is no problem, I just need an explanation." Here I realized that my brain had structured to understand each conversation as a problem trying to solve. So, I started to explain each field and what it does, my explanation was awful, so I played a video form the formal odoo website, and it worked, he finally got what he wants from 5 minutes video, which I still do not know what it was.
    * Lessons:
      1. when I talk to people have no background in programming or they are new to a system, start with a simple explanation for the purpose of the whole system moving to the purpose of each field.
      2. separate a normal conversation or question, than problem solving
