## [Email Server](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/applications/general/email_communication/email_servers.html)

You have nothing to do! Odoo sets up its own mail servers for your database. Outgoing and incoming emails work out-of-the-box!

Unless you plan to send large batches of mass mailing that could require the use of an external mail server, simply enjoy your new Odoo database.

## [Outlook Integration](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/saas-15.2/applications/general/calendars/outlook/outlook_calendar.html)

require active Azure account

as a solution we could sync outlook with [google](https://www.yesware.com/blog/sync-outlook-calendar-with-google-calendar/), then we sync google with odoo, since google has a free API
